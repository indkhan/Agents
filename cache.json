The flag was also used by the German Empire from 1848 to 1849. It was officially adopted as the national flag of the German Reich (during the period of the Weimar Republic) from 1919 to 1933, and has been in use since its reintroduction in Federal Republic of Germany in 1949.\n Since the mid-19th century, Germany has two competing traditions of national colours, black-red-gold and black-white-red.
